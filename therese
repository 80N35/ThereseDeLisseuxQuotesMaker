May I not say in my own name and in the name of unbelieving people: 'O God, be merciful to us sinners'?

Jesus, who fashions people's souls skillfully, does not want us to stand  about admiring the facade â€” he wants us to make our way in, till we reach the inner sanctuary which is His chosen dwelling and admire the beauty there.

My God, I choose all!  I don't want to be a saint by halves; I choose all that You will!

Our Lord never asks sacrifices from us beyond our strength. At times, it is true this Divine Savior makes us feel all the bitterness of the chalice that He is offering our soul. When He asks the sacrifice of all that is precious in this world, it is impossible, without a very special grace, not to cry out like Him in the garden of agonyâ€¦ It is very consoling to think that Jesus, the Strong God, knew our weaknesses.

I have noticed in all the serious circumstances of my life that nature always reflected the image of my soul. On days filled with tears the heavens cried along with me; on days of joy the sun sent forth its joyful rays in profusion, and the blue skies were not obscured by a single cloud.
