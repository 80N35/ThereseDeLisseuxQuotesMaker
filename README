Theres Quotes!

Just install fortune-mod (most distros or search for any fortune application and install that).  Drop "therese" and "therese.dat" into your home
directory and type "fortune therese".  If you get an error just rebuild the database with "strfile therese"

I have her quote command in my shell script so it runs automatically and I make an alias of "amen" if I want to hear another.

Thank you, Saint Therese!  Friggin beautiful genius who saved me!
